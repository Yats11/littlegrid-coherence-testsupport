    Implementation classes for cluster member group - typically these should suffice unless the behaviour
    needs to be changed - possible use cases requiring a different implementation might be if specialised
    start-up or shutdown was required, for instance if a cluster member should bind to a queue or perhaps
    initialise a database connection pool or maybe perform specialised wiring before the cluster member
    was started.
</p>

<p>
    If specialised behaviour was required and good examples might be needing to control things that happen
    before a cluster member starts up or shuts down, in these instances, the DefaultDelegatedClusterMember
    could be replaced with your own alternative implementation.
</p>

<p>
    Other ways that I could support the need for specific behaviour would be to provide a base-class and
    use the template method to provide hooks for things such as: doBeforeStart and doAfterShutdown - these
    are just ideas.
